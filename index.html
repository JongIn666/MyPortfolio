                <h2 class="section-title">Summary</h2>
                <p>I’m JongIn Lee, a Computer Science student at Purdue University (Software Engineering & Machine Learning track) 
                    with minors in Accounting and Mathematics. I’m South Korean, born and raised in Japan, and I love building 
                    products that sit at the intersection of real-world usefulness and solid engineering—from ML-powered 
                    applications to systems that can actually be deployed and maintained.
                    </br></br>
                    I started building projects because I wanted technology to feel more accessible and more helpful to people 
                    around me. That’s why I’m working on Muika, an offline AI chatbot focused on privacy and responsiveness, and 
                    an ASL practice web app designed to support learners with real-time feedback. Along the way, I’ve also 
                    explored creative engineering through a Unity gravity-based puzzle simulation and learned how tools really 
                    work by implementing a mini compiler from scratch.
                    </br></br>
                    Academically, I’m motivated by courses that challenge how I think: CS 381 (Introduction to Algorithms) 
                    pushed me hard, but it also fueled my curiosity to understand why solutions work; CS 473 (Web Information 
                    Search & Management) showed me how ML ideas translate into systems people actually use; and CS 352 (Compilers) 
                    surprised me—I didn’t expect to enjoy it, but I became genuinely interested in parsing, optimization, and how 
                    languages become executable programs. I’m currently taking Software Testing and Software Engineering I, and 
                    I’m also learning through Coursera in areas like AWS, SQL, and cloud computing to strengthen my ability to ship 
                    production-ready software and earn AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.
                    </br></br>
                    My core strengths are building end-to-end: Python + TypeScript, Next.js/React, TensorFlow, and AWS (Cognito, 
                    Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3), with experience in Docker and CI/CD. I’m especially interested in ML 
                    applications, scalable systems, and product development that can make a positive impact on communities.

                <p>I don’t really have “one hobby.” My interests changes time to time—when something catches my attention, 
                    I might dive in, I might not, and then follow the next curiosity. Recently I started learning piano on an 
                    electronic keyboard I got from a friend. Last year I was fully obsessed with Sudoku. In high school, I played 
                    trumpet in jazz band, and before that I played flute because my older brother did.
                </br></br>
                    I think athletics shaped who I am a lot. I spent four years in cross country, wrestling, and track. Running 
                    felt natural—maybe because I was on the light side. Wrestling was different. I started freshman year under 
                    100 pounds, and it was easily the hardest thing I chose to do. I wasn’t good at first, but I stayed because 
                    it built discipline and put me around people I never would have met otherwise. By senior year I could win most 
                    matches, but I also learned something important: losing feels terrible to me—and that’s exactly what drives me. 
                    It pushes me to improve, refine, and come back stronger.
                </br></br>
                    In college I picked up judo, and right now I’m training for a full marathon. I’m want to stay active and 
                    healthy, but I try to do it sustainably: strong enough to keep going, but not so intense that I break my body.
                </br></br>
                    If there’s one interest that’s been consistent throughout my life, it’s art. If I hadn’t chosen computer 
                    science, I might have pursued art. I grew up drawing, took IB Art HL in high school, and 
                    rediscovered that side of myself while designing instragram post for Purdue’s Japanese Student Association. 
                    I love the process of turning ideas into visuals.
